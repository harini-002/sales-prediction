# sales-prediction

This machine learning project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using data from Kaggle, based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, fare, and family size. The project is built using Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression or Random Forest to estimate survival chances with good accuracy.

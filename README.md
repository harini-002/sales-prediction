# sales-prediction

This machine learning project predicts product sales based on advertising spending across different media such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The dataset contains historical advertising budgets and corresponding sales, and the goal is to build a regression model that accurately forecasts sales. The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R² Score.
